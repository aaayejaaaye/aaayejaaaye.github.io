This has been a few years in the making! I'm happy to say this is the most satisfied I have ever been with a setup. I bought my desk in 2016 from Ikea and it is this massive beautiful slab of cork, yes cork. It has been the base inspiration for all of my aesthetic choices. I had a Lenovo laptop previously that didn't last as long as a felt it should, but I have recently upgraded to my dream laptop, Razer Blade 15. As technology goes, I could always do some updating every few years!<!--more-->

I really like the [Lifx Beam](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B073177QS8/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B073177QS8&linkCode=as2&tag=aaayejaaaye07-20&linkId=90752c27e9c6408458a7b2c41cb7188d)

<h2>Laptop</h2>

My review is a bit biased because my previous laptop was truly atrocious and was used far past its shelf life. That is why I'm am in love with this laptop, the design is so sleek and modern. Unlike the previous gen, Razer opted to go with the pointed edges vs round and that really gives it a more premium feel. The weight is 4.5 pounds which is a tremendous improvement from my former 8 pound 17.5" monster laptop. I did consider other high performance laptops but the idea of carrying around another 17" monster around campus was not appealing to me, or my back. I was willing to pay the price for the form factor even if there are comparable laptops for the performance. On the downside, I did get the 256 GB SSD, which has been a bit troublesome. I am a huge Witcher fan and am slowly working my way through the expansions. Having said that, I can only really keep about 3 games downloaded at a time including all the other software I use for content creation. A small price to pay, given how fast everything moves I really cant complain if I have to temporarily uninstall some programs in favor of a more frequently used one. If anything it helps me keep things organized better.

<h2>Headphones</h2>

I personally decided to go with the Razer Nari because I had a Razer laptop, and they both user Chroma. These are not commuting headphones, so if you want grab and go versatility I don't recommend these. I love using the Chroma Studio with the Synapse app and integrating the headphones with my Razer software just seemed like a natural fit. The Razer Nari is a great headset, I think, I also enjoy the customization I get with the laptop and the headset. I will make a future post about Razer Synapse and such in the future.

<h2>Bluetooth Keyboard and Mouse</h2>

I love both of these so much. I usually bring the mouse with me to campus and the keyboard is quiet and low so I don't have to tilt my wrist too high.

Thank you for checking out my setup. Time to do some homework.

I recently had my birthday Sunday and I went to Denver and on the way home my spouse took this photo.
