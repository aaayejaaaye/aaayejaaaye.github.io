I live in Colorado so by the time this is posted our stay at home order will be through BUT, I just want to add that I have been playing DND virtually more than I have played in person. My very first campaign was virtually. We are really going to focus on the best way to emulate the in person experience.

We are going to do a deep dive here. I will say I am biased but I did get input from several others on the best way to play online. If you have done any research into this at all then you know the top three are Fantasy Grounds, Roll20, and Table Top Simulator. I'll be reviewing these each from most familiar to least.

Prerequisites:
Computer
Webcam(optional)/Microphone
Friends with their own computer/laptop/webcam/microphone

Alternative:
If you are really trying to be budget conscious just use a smart phone.
**Character Sheets**
I make a google sheet but they're are plenty of online character sheets you can download if you want.
when I first started I used DND beyond character creator tool and that is great to get an undstanding of what you should be looking for but i reccomend moving away from the quickly because most of the intersting factors are behind a pay wall.(unless you want to pay the $).



Research

5e tools
By far the best platform for finding (reliable) information for building your character.  

DND Beyond
Great for a very beginner but depending on how into the experience you get you wil quickly outgrow the free material.

**Table Top Simulator**

**Roll20**

**Fantasy Grounds**
