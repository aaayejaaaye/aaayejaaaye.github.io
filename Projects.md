<h3>Nasa Suits</h3>

 2019's challenge was to created a augmented reality user interface or AR UI that would be able to assist astronauts during extravehicular activities, such as maintenance on the space station. I was the programming lead for the 2019 challenge. The role involved a good amount of UI/UX as well as programming. The team was small so while programming lead was my title I had the my hands involved in a bit of everything. We developed the capabilities to have the HUD fixed or placed in world space, navigational markers that can be placed in world space and are persistent, and integrated an EMG device into the design. We also worked on but did not integrate, object recognition using Microsoft Azure, and screen sharing capabilities. We also worked on updating the UI to make it more readable and functional by adding pictures and the before mentioned HUD flexibility.
 I was in charge  setting up the initial project, designating task, creating and updating the version control, timelines. As well  researching and programming the Egocentric/world displays, the navigational markers, adding photo capabilities to the UI, and helped with integration of the EMG.

 The 2020 challenge was focused more on Artemis and creating a AR HUD for astronauts on the lunar surface. Much like last years challenge the goal was to created the HUD with task instructions in mind. Unlike 2019's design there was also the addition of navigation to the rover, rover maintenance, and a science task which included soil sample collection. I was not the programming lead, but I did provide guidance early on to the new team of programmers. I helped set up the initial project, program the beta task instructions and helped with integration of the server. Unfortunately due to CO-VID we did not have a team fly to Houston to test out the designs at JSC.

<h3>Technical Writing and Design</h3>
For Spring 2019 I took a technical writing and design course. For this course we reached out to and organization and proceeded to work on a design related project that they needed done pro bono. My group of three chose a club at CU that I happen to be a member of. The CUTEE (CU Technologies for Extreme Environments) club is a student organization that designs human centered assistive technologies for space exploration and other environments. We created a design document, project charter, and filled time sheets. Our objectives and final deliverables where as follows:
- Act as a consultant and design experts in the ideation and creation of the outreach banner
- Help with CUTEE logo design 
- Get the CU logo design approved by the CU Office of University Relations
- Help with templating banner and a tablecloth so CUTEE club can have a consistent image

<h3>Website Analyzer</h3>
Fall 2019 Semester I took Software Development and Methods. We formed teams and worked on a semester long project where we created a website analyzer. This application will take in your chosen website and analyze the content of the page(s). This includes, but is not limited to, metadata about your chosen site, (how the content is shown, percentages) as well as specific analysis of the text. We had to create documentation and follow project plan which we did through Github.

<h3>Human Computer Interaction</h3>
Fall 2018 Semester I took Human Computer Interaction. For this semester project we had to create a prototype of an application of our choice. We had to:
- complete a project plan
- conduct design research
- crete paper prototypes
- usability and heuristic evaluations
- create story boards and present a final prototype using Figma

The app we create was a magic the gathering application. It's purpose was to provide a way for players to track interaction of decks via articles and post with functions including delete, edit, and write. It includes a social media aspect where the user can easily share and view others people post to make researching and browsing articles quick and efficient
