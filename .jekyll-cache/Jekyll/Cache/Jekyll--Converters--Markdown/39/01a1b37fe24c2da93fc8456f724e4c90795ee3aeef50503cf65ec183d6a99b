<p>Ah yes, Unity, Throughout the years of being an aspiring game developer/CS graduate/billionaire/philanthropist(ehehe) I have followed hundreds of Unity tutorials. I would consider myself an intermediate beginner as a Unity user however, I find that I can still find some real quality intro Unity tutorials that I can benefit from(usually not free). If you look up Unity 3D/Game Development or any other popular keywords for aspiring game makers in an analytics tool you will see that the results are both highly sought after and also‚Ä¶ highly saturated (I‚Äôm a small fish in a big pond).</p>
