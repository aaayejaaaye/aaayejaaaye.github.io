<strong>Hello Hello,</strong></p>

<p>If you are on the internet looking for a tutorial on ARCore or AR Foundation you might be receiving mixed information on the configurations. Never fear, I am hear to hold your hand. Donâ€™t worry I wont casually gloss over critical details. This tutorial assumes this your first time building an Android application. If you want to try the <a href="https://developers.google.com/ar/develop/unity/quickstart-android">ARCore official Instructions</a> please do. I find that a combination of these plus my own knowledge of unity works best. If you plan on using the ARFoundation package for Unity you will also need to view these instructions <a href="https://developers.google.com/ar/develop/unity-arf/quickstart-android">Quickstart for ARCore Extensions for Android.</a></p>
