<strong>This is the second part of my discussion with Christian Hill</strong> If you haven‚Äôt checked out the first half of the interview where we talk about accessibility and transhumanism. <a href="https://aaayejaaaye.com/2020/02/24/Chris-EMG-Interview.html">Click Here.</a> What started as a discussion on innovation and AR/VR quickly turned into our experience as African Americans and our first impressions of being in the ‚Äútechnology‚Äù industry has been so far.</p>

<p><strong>Chris:</strong>
<strong>AJ:</strong>
Empathy is really important. I think that‚Äôs a good one. It makes me think of when people talk about accessibility and empathy and things like that with technology. I feel like sometimes you get these really brainy types that are just focused on their GPA and getting an A. It just feels like sometimes there‚Äôs not a lot of empathy there as far as people that create certain technologies, where they‚Äôre just like, well if you don‚Äôt get it, then you don‚Äôt get it. That‚Äôs terrible to think like that.</p>

<p><strong>AJ:</strong>
Okay, so now here comes AR/VR questions. Let‚Äôs explain the picture of EMG first and how you‚Äôve integrated, something that you were interested in, which is accessibility, into an AR/VR context.</p>

<p><strong>Chris:</strong>
Yeah so NASA SUITS for the first part of the project I developed a EMG device. Basically EMG stands for electromyography. It measures the electric potential, the most these cars when they move. So, you know, a lot of people think that electricity and their body are completely separated email electricity will kill them. Not true your body actually generates a good electricity and your heart is a perfect example of that to wear EKG very similar where we‚Äôre working with EMG measures the electric potential of your heart when it beats the heart beats, it creates some sort of electric field through measure.</p>

<p>So basically, we went to participate in the NASA SUTIS project. I care very little about space, I still do. But I care very much about the idea of these people in space having accessibility needs that probably match people on earth.</p>

<p>So for example if people are developing technology just for NASA, and they keep it closed source. They‚Äôre not interested in sharing it, then it doesn‚Äôt really benefit anybody except NASA if you make it open source. Then there‚Äôs a ton of hundreds of thousands of different people who have difficulties that the EVA astronauts face every single day on ground. So, I wanted to create a device that allowed for really anyone to interface with a AR/VR headset display in a way that is novel in a way that uses some sort of different body function that does involve the hands or to interact with their display.</p>

<p><strong>AJ:</strong> Oh, that‚Äôs amazing that‚Äôs I love that, I love the EMG, I love the idea behind it. It wasn‚Äôt until we were presenting the like last day that we were there that I realized, what your inspiration was for the EMG. Once I found that out I was like, That‚Äôs so cool.</p>

<p>It made me think of when I‚Äôm thinking about something, is this accessible to people? For me, maybe I don‚Äôt have a physical impediment, just thinking about accessibility to people. And that‚Äôs really something that‚Äôs important to me, just from across cultural backgrounds, you know, I think. Colorado is really different from Kansas. And then, you know, the typical socio economic groups right?</p>

<p>Compared to Kansas Colorado is a very higher ed educated place right? So the opportunities here are so great when you‚Äôre even just in high school, you know, and I‚Äôm just like, Man, this is like everybody here is so educated people look at Kansas where you when you could buy a house in Kansas on a modest salary.</p>

<p><strong>Chris:</strong>
Yeah, and I mean, in my mind, there‚Äôs a difference between accessibility and creating a device that is accessible to everybody. So for example, there‚Äôs a lot of accessible technology that is completely amazing, but it is not made for me, and I can‚Äôt use it or interact with in a way that sort of opens up my horizons or open it up in my opinion of how difficult or how, how much people who are differently abled have to experience the world in many ways. So what I‚Äôm really interested in is bridging that gap, and certainly how to create things that create empathy, letting people in, and sort of add a genuine understanding. So 20 years from now, when someone is creating the next accessibility device, they‚Äôre like well, we can create it for just one population to the other population to create something that benefits both populations</p>

<p><strong>AJ:</strong>
Yeah, for sure. So I tried to think about explaining how to use a smartphone for augmented reality with children. This is starting from zero, you know. Making technology unintimidating and making STEM unintimidating to people is something that I‚Äôm feeling passionate about, like, I feel like everybody can benefit from learning a little bit about STEM. So just making it seem like accessible is really important.</p>

<p>Which of your projects have you worked on do you think they will integrate best into AR/VR.</p>

<p><strong>Chris:</strong>
I mean all sorts. Sorry, that‚Äôs honestly a difficult question.
So, I see, the 20th century, that‚Äôs the physics generation. I see the 21st century as the biological generation. As a part of that I see possibly the seeds of the 22nd century being the AR/VR generation. With the idea that right now we, you know, again, very similar to what I‚Äôve been talking about. You either developing AR and VR or you don‚Äôt develop for AR/VR. I think in the future, people, those are going to be so intermeshed that people will see no different between the devices. There‚Äôll be an interconnectivity.</p>

<p><strong>AJ:</strong> Here‚Äôs hoping, Yeah, definitely. I‚Äôm putting my eggs in the basket and I better get a return.</p>

<p><strong>Chris:</strong>
But currently, I feel like all my projects to have some sort of benefit in a AR/VR environment built for that device, I guess.</p>

<p>So, for example, the glove that I developed that allowed you have longer length fingers; You look at the device and you can tell that it‚Äôs clearly hardware. You can tell there‚Äôs clearly developed by a sophomore engineer. But in AR/VR we‚Äôve been able to feel that device, have the same interactions, able to feel same tactile responses tactile meaning the same physical responses. But you get the same visual, as if it was your own hands and fingers(with AR/VR). So me as a designer designing human augmentation, or augmentations that are meant to be like an animal senses I‚Äôm limited by my own knowledge and skill but my own design prowess. That‚Äôs something that isn‚Äôt really I feel like isn‚Äôt a limitation in VR. To where I can have whatever I designed to look for our design, and have it interact however I want it to interact. So I feel like everything I designed could be implemented in an AR/VR context.</p>

<p><strong>After this I proceeded to ask Chris a rap up question to just list all the projects he has worked on. Let me tell you it is an impressive amount for the 23 year old. I highly encourage you to check out the links below for more information.  In the next portion we have a discussion on more personal maters. Family, Identity, and our experiences as so far emerging into the tech industry.</strong></p>

<p><strong>AJ:</strong>
I like I like sharing this stuff with family cause they are asking me questions all the time about this stuff. So, yeah.</p>

<p>Unknown 15:12
Okay.</p>

<p>Unknown 15:14
I‚Äôm talking about this on my.</p>

<p>Unknown 15:17
Actually I remember the freakout.</p>

<p>Unknown 15:21
I told my dad and my mom was like, I got a C plus on my exam and my dad was like a C plus.</p>

<p>Unknown 15:30
I never got a C plus in my in my mom, she‚Äôs like</p>

<p>Unknown 15:38
my dad was so impressed.</p>

<p>Unknown 15:42
Yeah, I mean, I don‚Äôt know, maybe we should this is a bonus round, folks. But let‚Äôs talk about being a minority in tech.</p>

<p>Unknown 15:53
I know we had briefly discussed what your ethnic background is, yeah.</p>

<p>Unknown 15:59
I said to Africa I guess this assumptions. Maybe I was bad, but like Christian you African American and maybe some other things. Yeah. And what is your ethnic background and how has that played a role in kind of how you approach.</p>

<p>Unknown 16:19
I want to say a field that is predominantly homogenous mostly white, white, white white males, come from.</p>

<p>Unknown 16:35
I would assume this assumption backgrounds of their parents or engineers right so then their kids are going to be engineering these right like kids that knew they were going to go into stem from very young ages. Did you know that you were going to be in some engager sanctions.</p>

<p>Unknown 16:55
Did you know you were going to get into stem from a young age or did it kind of becomes like When did you get the call, like the confidence or the knowledge that you knew you were going to get into STEM and how has your background affected how you approach it.</p>

<p>Unknown 17:12
So I would say I got to see him for a lot of reasons.</p>

<p>Unknown 17:18
As a kid, I did not. So I your brother in my household who‚Äôs similar my age, and he was very much into STEM. I was very much drawn to stem. I felt like if I gone to stem ship in the back of my head.</p>

<p>Unknown 17:36
But I took CS classes, and I saw I looked up a monster and I saw a CS degree. Okay. And I was like, Okay, this for me was like okay yeah, I can do this, I get the idea.</p>

<p>Unknown 17:51
But then I want to see your folder for the opportunities, and I met a professor who really. I you know I hate to say the word colorblind, but I could tell that he was interesting to me because of who I am. That‚Äôs amazing. Yeah, because I, I just want to add. As a person of color. For me personally, it feels like sometimes I question whether people are into me. Because it‚Äôs a tax code is their enemy because they actually believe in me. Yeah, yeah, you know, and so, growing up, you know, I don‚Äôt know better way to put this but it was like, you know, it was me. And then the other end of the line, it was the police and teachers</p>

<p>Unknown 18:39
like people who like to trust, you know, and so throughout my whole entire life I was like, you know, teachers were with us they‚Äôre just coming into a job. At the end, we don‚Äôt talk to each other. They don‚Äôt care. Personally, and then we split up, but I met him and took a genuine interest in who I am as a person, not only when I was in school as person but outside of school as a person.</p>

<p>Unknown 19:05
And then, what really was really innovative to me was, you know, felt like I made a friend, not a professor. And, you know, that‚Äôs really good. And eventually like I would say that my coworker, Mike Eisenberg and his wife and Eisenberg, and they were both like her parent figures to me, you know, and losing him was like losing a dad hundred percent you know, and.</p>

<p>Unknown 19:31
And I would say like that, that specific relationship is the reason why I‚Äôm going into teaching, getting my PhD. Yeah, I think that there‚Äôs 1000 maybe every student feels this way, and they just need someone who is interested in not only their technical prowess. But the way that they think is a person and the big picture ideas that they really feel like could impact their work, as well as other words, yeah so that‚Äôs a good bonus question.</p>

<p>Unknown 20:01
Like, things like that person‚Äôs like I love the questions that how I live all questions that I‚Äôve asked so far and the answers you‚Äôve given, but I didn‚Äôt even think about touching on, you know, just our cultural background. Yeah, things like that, but I think that that‚Äôs important that I went to the event. The other day, man.</p>

<p>Unknown 20:26
I don‚Äôt know some African Americans feel this way but there‚Äôs a difference between an African African and African American. And, you know, mostly really only kids of color there there were that were that I could identify as being like, identifying is going into some more African Africa in Africa for a reason why African Americans. And so, like, I‚Äôm not sure what it is, why there‚Äôs not very many African Americans.</p>

<p>Unknown 20:54
I know personally for me. It was more like a representation issue.</p>

<p>Unknown 20:59
I‚Äôve never I didn‚Äôt really see people that looked like me, featured in articles and it took me a really long time to get the confidence to pursue this you know there was an interest.</p>

<p>Unknown 21:11
So that‚Äôs, that‚Äôs interesting. Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p>Unknown 21:15
Even on a college level, I feel like they have cases that are for Africans in STEM or African Americans against.</p>

<p>Unknown 21:24
But those people are not my type of people.</p>

<p>Unknown 21:30
You know like the people that I grew up with. They don‚Äôt like stem.</p>

<p>Unknown 21:35
I‚Äôm the weird one.</p>

<p>Unknown 21:37
We‚Äôre like, Who are those people. You know who are the people you are outside of our life I connected with, you know, they don‚Äôt feel like they‚Äôre being represented. They‚Äôre being simply talk to you know their interests sorry and passion and interest HS are pretty much unusable tire area that is dedicated people who are smart in high school. Yeah, and I feel like Baron do talk to you right now. Yeah. And those are the people are going to create the big ideas you know our next generation yeah those are the people who know our people who know our culture. You know, for example you know you think back to the 70s they think back to portable notation bill for those those are targeting a specific demographic that never talked to targeted to you again.</p>

<p>Unknown 22:26
Still freeze, a new demographic and made boatloads of money for people who do not care about this community right yeah no so like how do we avoid that, as engineers. Avoid the idea of us being utilized just for our knowledge of our communities. So, yeah, definitely</p>

<p>Unknown 22:49
tough questions here.</p>

<p>Unknown 22:51
Yeah, this is more than likely I don‚Äôt know this this is good that we‚Äôre talking about it because then they can appeal to you know what I mean.</p>

<p>Unknown 23:01
Yeah, that‚Äôs just not a conversation that‚Äôs really had this is more like like whatever I hear about minorities in STEM I think we need more of them. And then I had a friend, a friend that I was telling you about this study. Nope. Leave this part out.</p>

<p>Unknown 23:15
The friend was studying neuroscience and NYC. He was talking about this club three‚Äôs a party I was like this prestigious club of people that know how to do programming.</p>

<p>Unknown 23:28
And then he was like you should join us to try to join for this like didn‚Äôt come for a semester or something. They have really good affirmative action programs. Yeah, and I was like, Oh, when did you put it like that</p>

<p>Unknown 23:44
mean it‚Äôs not diverse enough for like, what, what do you what do you want from me.</p>

<p>Unknown 23:51
So I don‚Äôt know I just it‚Äôs, it‚Äôs a hard balance of being colorblind, and then being like needing needing that input.</p>

<p>Unknown 24:05
And then meeting room or meeting people that are from diverse backgrounds, because they‚Äôre like your parents are in STEM uberaba say encourage you to be in STEM so you become really good at math.</p>

<p>Unknown 24:18
And then that‚Äôs your whole world and then you‚Äôre like, I‚Äôm a really smart person. According to society right.</p>

<p>Unknown 24:26
I‚Äôm sorry. It‚Äôs like the only reason I‚Äôm laughing is because my spouse was like that type of person where like, I‚Äôm gonna meet them. and I‚Äôm going to sit in aerospace, and I got to be really good at math and science, I‚Äôm going to dedicate myself listen childhood.</p>

<p>Unknown 24:45
And that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm gonna do and then they got to college and they‚Äôre like, I don‚Äôt want to do it.</p>

<p>Unknown 24:52
The way that I see sound currently, and better way in the actual article but first I would say, I would say that no phrase better.</p>

<p>Unknown 25:02
That minorities are kind of treated like a dog chasing.</p>

<p>Unknown 25:08
Okay, yes, you know, like we don‚Äôt know why we want it. We don‚Äôt know. Whenever we know that we want it, because people tell us that we want it Yeah, right. We see it and then once we get to it, and we patch it, and we see that it isn‚Äôt for us yeah we see that it is something that is not moving way faster than we can move, yeah we‚Äôre like, well, I‚Äôm already. I‚Äôve already lost my house I don‚Äôt know how to get back there. So I guess I‚Äôm just gonna keep walking.</p>

<p>Unknown 25:37
Yeah.</p>

<p>Unknown 25:41
I don‚Äôt know how to deal with, with it, but at work I had some issues early with. And it wasn‚Äôt like an indirect nobody I work with directly so thank God.</p>

<p>Unknown 25:53
At least not towards African Americans but</p>

<p>Unknown 25:59
it‚Äôs it‚Äôs hard to deal with, like, people that have prejudices, or have really huge generalizations about certain communities.</p>

<p>Unknown 26:10
At work, there was, I was attending a workshop, which included all the people that were developers or business people, And they were like,</p>

<p>Unknown 26:24
he was from California, and like my parents are from California, so it‚Äôs like your mom‚Äôs from California right. Some of her family members are kind of from California. So my mom. My mom was born and raised in Los Angeles, and has certain ideas about how African American to me a nice word. And then she moved to Kansas.</p>

<p>Unknown 26:48
And that‚Äôs the only other thing she‚Äôs looking to places is California or Lawrence, Kansas.</p>

<p>Unknown 26:58
In what she grew up with when lost when she was growing up as a boomer South Central Los Angeles was a totally different place than what the stereotype is of what it is now. And so her idea of what the black community in California is is completely different to what it is now. And so, I forgot where I was going with this. But there was this guy that was discussing about people with different cultural groups mixing at my at my place of work.</p>

<p>Unknown 27:33
He had really kind of negative opinions about African Americans in California. And from my experience, like just hearing what my mom has said about what she grew up with. It sounds like it was much more of a community than it is, then what the media is interpreting it to me right now.</p>

<p>Unknown 27:53
So I don‚Äôt know, I just, I didn‚Äôt know how to really handle that situation, it was, it was really awkward because he told the other side of this like long conference room. He was talking loud enough that I can hear it he was talking about how many African Americans they don‚Äôt want to be integrated into these white schools because they prefer to be with people of their own color, but they‚Äôre more comfortable that way. And I‚Äôm like you‚Äôre projecting your own opinions on yourself, first of all.</p>

<p>Unknown 28:26
At the same time, we live in, we live in Boulder, Colorado,</p>

<p>Unknown 28:33
sure that I‚Äôm colorblind because I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs progressive either. But</p>

<p>Unknown 28:41
we live in Boulder, Colorado, and it often is the case where and we were honestly like okay I know our team for NASA suits, we have the most women and we had the most minorities on our team last year hopefully this year and hopefully this smart notes are novel.</p>

<p>Unknown 29:02
That‚Äôs true. That‚Äôs a good idea. Good idea that‚Äôs Yes, yes, most diverse group there.</p>

<p>Unknown 29:10
So, seems kind of. It‚Äôs just like my mom kind of made me I was like, in tune to these kind of pods like okay maybe that sonica they pay that‚Äôs not good. That is, and then move on to teen science cafe. And notice if I didn‚Äôt notice when I was kind of like okay but these kids are already in the sound. Their parents are probably in tears my co workers are older and have kids.</p>

<p>Unknown 29:40
They‚Äôre gearing their kids towards some fields.</p>

<p>Unknown 29:43
Get the cycle.</p>

<p>Unknown 29:45
How do you get the students that aren‚Äôt necessarily make it and I was one of these students who was very intimidated by stem. I thought no i don‚Äôt see people that look like me doing this. Why would I pursue this. No, I don‚Äôt want I don‚Äôt want to be like a groundbreaker, I wasn‚Äôt confident enough I would say to do that.</p>

<p>Unknown 30:07
But how do you get people that maybe are intimidated by some feel to be more to feel like they‚Äôre included in these areas of innovation. Oh, my God.</p>

<p>Unknown 30:26
Okay, a child. I feel really bad. She‚Äôs crying and I feel really bad I don‚Äôt want to speak</p>

<p>Unknown 30:41
just dying.</p>

<p>Unknown 30:48
Really bad I just asked a question to the child fell, don‚Äôt want to go in my ear my mouth no</p>

<p>Unknown 30:59
more. I just have to serious question and then this poor blond haired blue eyed white child.</p>

<p>Unknown 31:12
I feel very strongly that minorities are the future and I</p>

<p>Unknown 31:19
record. Okay.</p>

<p>Unknown 31:23
All right.</p>

<p>Unknown 31:24
So, I have Chris Hill, or Christian. Chris or Christopher, formerly here, it‚Äôs important. Okay, I have Chris Hill hill here and we‚Äôre going to we‚Äôre in a Mexican restaurant. We just ate tacos and nachos. And we‚Äôre drinking margaritas. And we‚Äôre going to talk about Chris and how awesome he is. Hello, Chris.</p>

<p>Unknown 31:45
Hi. Um, so I guess the first question is, How did you tell us about yourself.</p>
