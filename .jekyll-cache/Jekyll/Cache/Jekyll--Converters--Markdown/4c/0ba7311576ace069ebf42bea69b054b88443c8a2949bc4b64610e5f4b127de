<p>Hi Techies, So I’ve been playing around with Jekyll for about a month getting this blog running. I spent two weeks of that trying to format and edit a Jekyll them that was way past my level of understanding when I had a eureka moment of the design saying, ‘Keep it simple stupid’. I am not trying to be a web designer or anything. I needed to just stick to the basics and work my way up.</p>
