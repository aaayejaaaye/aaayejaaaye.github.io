Welcome to aaayejaaaye, (pronounced AJ)</p>

<p>Iâ€™m AJ! Currently Iâ€™m studying computer science in beautiful Colorado. This blog is where I document my passion for augmented/virtual reality as well as game development and design. I have so many plans! I have been serious about learning Unity for about a year now and I feel in that time I have learned so much! my primary experience has been working with the Microsoft Hololens AR heads up Display for NASA! ( See Experience Page)</p>

<p>I am still involved with the Hololens projects to a lesser capacity, but I wanted to start focusing on learning how to make AR experiences with more accessible devices. I will be documenting my learned knowledge as well as my process of creating applications using Vuforia, Mixed Reality Tool Kit, Spark AR, ARCore, Unity, and more!</p>

<p>Eventually I would like to invest in a VR headset and create lessons on how to build your own AR/VR applications.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m looking foreword to digging deeper into the world of AR/VR and sharing that with you!</p>

<p>Best,</p>

<p>AJ</p>
