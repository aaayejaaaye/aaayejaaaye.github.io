<h3>Hello welcome to the design portion of my blogging adventure! This is the second half of my post on how I created this blog. I am not trying to be a web designer or full stack developer, so spending a lot of time getting this perfect wasn't a priority. Yet, I still found the default Minima theme to be... not my style. I initially was over ambitious with my design, too many ideas.  I want to use this blog to get my projects and ideas out there, and look pretty good in the process. I had a eureka moment working on the design. I thought, 'Keep It Simple Stupid'. I needed to just stick to the basics and work my way up.
