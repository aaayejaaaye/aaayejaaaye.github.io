<p>Ah Yes, Unity, Throughout the years of being an aspiring game developer/CS graduate/ billionaire/ philanthropist(ehehe) I have followed hundreds of Unity tutorials. I would consider myself an intermediate beginner as a Unity user however, I find that I can still find some real quality intro Unity tutorials that I can benefit from(usually not free). If you look up Unity 3D/Game Development or any other popular keywords for aspiring game makers in an analytics tool you will see that the results are both highly sought after and alsoâ€¦ highly saturated (Iâ€™m a small fish in a big pond).</p>
