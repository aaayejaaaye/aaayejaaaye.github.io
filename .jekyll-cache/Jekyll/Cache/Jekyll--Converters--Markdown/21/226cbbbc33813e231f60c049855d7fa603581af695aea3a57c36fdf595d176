<p>Im not going to lie, When I started learning Unity I was interested in the three main areas: scripting, UI, and augmented reality. I B-lined it straight to those topics and was completely lost. After a while I still learned a lot, but it wasnâ€™t until I finally took the time to just learn the basics that I realized just how much knowledge I was missing out on(with the right tutorial).</p>
