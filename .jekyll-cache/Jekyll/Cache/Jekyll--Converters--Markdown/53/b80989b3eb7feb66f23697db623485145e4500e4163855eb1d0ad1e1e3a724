<p>This post is more about being apart of the end of year zeitgeist than writing anything meaningful. The most exciting part of AR/VR is the future of AR/VR. I live in Colorado which has a surprising amount of AR/VR jobs, mostly because enterprise, aerospace and military contracts are outsource to companies here. This is atypical to most of the country but most people with a smart phone have access to some form of augmented reality. (AKA the Amazon app) I am mostly excited for what the future holds. I’ll loosely quote some great thinker and say, “To create the future we must understand our past” <strong><em>stares deeply and meaningfully at the sun setting over the rocky mountains.</em></strong>

Believe it or not virtual reality has been around since the 90’s. And AR has been around since the early 00’s. the 10’s have seen immense improvement since the dark ages of AR/VR. I would say for me AR became extremely popular during this time because the Pokémon Go! The 20’s will only grow and improve this tech, which if you didn’t know, I am so excited! The critics say its a gimmick or fad. Technology is being innovated faster than ever before.  I would even argue that tech companies are practicing the Minimum Viable Product concept of product design because even if we created the perfect AR/VR experience on paper, it means nothing if users hate the experience. I would say all the AR/VR tech from this past decade is still in beta testing. So it fair to say maybe some aspect are gimmicky or a fad, but this technology is not going anywhere.</p>
