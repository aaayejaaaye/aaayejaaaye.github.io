<p>This tutorial is for those with Basic understanding of HTML, CSS, CMD, IDE’s, etc. Of course I will not discourage someone with out any experience to not try this, I’m just gonna say, If you want this to be easy and seamless then head over to WordPress, Wix, or whatever and give them your money. No shade, seriously. If you have the basic skills, and time, you can create a blog on the cheap!</p>
