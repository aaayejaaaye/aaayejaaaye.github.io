<p>I considered doing a decade review, but that would require a lot of research and I don‚Äôt want to do that. I am on winter break after all. This post is more about being apart of the end of year zeitgeist than writing anything meaningful. The most exciting part of AR/VR is the future of AR/VR. I live in Colorado which has a surprising amount of AR/VR jobs, mostly because enterprise, aerospace and military contracts are outsource to companies here. This is atypical to most of the country but most people with a smart phone have access to some form of augmented reality. (AKA the Amazon app) I am mostly excited for what the future holds. I‚Äôll loosley quote some great thinker and say, ‚ÄúTo create the future we must understand our past‚Äù <strong><em>stares deeply and meaningfully at the sun setting over the rocky mountains.</em></strong></p>
