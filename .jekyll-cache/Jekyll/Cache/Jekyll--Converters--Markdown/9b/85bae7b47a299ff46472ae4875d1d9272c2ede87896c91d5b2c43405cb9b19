<p>Hi Techies, So Iâ€™ve been playing around with Jekyll for about a month getting this blog running. I spent two weeks of that trying to format and edit a Jekyll them that was way past my level of understanding when I had a eureka moment of the design saying, â€˜Keep it simple stupidâ€™. I am not trying to be a web designer or anything. I needed to just stick to the basics and work my way up.</p>

<p>This tutorial is for those with Basic understanding of HTML, CSS, CMD, IDEâ€™s, etc. Of course I will not discourage someone with out any experience to not try this, Iâ€™m just gonna say, If you want this to be easy and seamless then head over to WordPress, Wix, or whatever and give them your money. No shade,</p>
