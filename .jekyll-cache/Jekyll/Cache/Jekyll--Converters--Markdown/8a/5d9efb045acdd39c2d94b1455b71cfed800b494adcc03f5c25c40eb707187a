<p>This has been a few years in the making! I’m happy to say this is the most satisfied I have ever been with a setup. I bought my desk in 2016 from Ikea and it is this massive beautiful slab of cork, yes cork. It has been the base inspiration for all of my aesthetic choices. I had a Lenovo laptop previously that didn’t last as long as a felt it should, but I have recently upgraded to my dream laptop, Razer Blade 15. As technology goes, I could always do some updating every few years!</p>
