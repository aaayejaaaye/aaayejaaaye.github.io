<p>Ah yes, Unity, Throughout the years of being an aspiring game developer/CS graduate/billionaire/philanthropist(ehehe) I have followed hundreds of Unity tutorials. I would consider myself an intermediate beginner as a Unity user however, I find that I can still find some real quality intro Unity tutorials that I can benefit from(usually not free). If you look up Unity 3D/Game Development or any other popular keywords for aspiring game makers in an analytics tool you will see that the results are both highly sought after and also… highly saturated (I’m a small fish in a big pond).<!--more--> So mulling through these results and finding the right tutorial that wont waste your time is essential in the beginning stages of you game making journey. Having said that, I have learned a few things about the DO’s and DONT’S of trying to follow along. If you are looking for some basic Unity tutorials check out my <a href="/2019/11/14/Best-Unity-Tutorials-For-Beginners-2019.html">Best Unity Tutorials for Beginners in 2019</a>  So without further ado, Here are the 10 Commandments for beginners following a Unity tutorial online:</p>
