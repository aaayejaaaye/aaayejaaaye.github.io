<p>How long has this been a thing!?(August) Itâ€™s fantastic, super easy, and fun!</p>

<p>I was recently googling â€œAR Software 2019,â€ and found Spark AR show up in several of my results. At first I was reluctant because I personally donâ€™t currently use Instagram or Facebook filters (but have been considering it).</p>
