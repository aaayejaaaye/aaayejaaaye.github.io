<p>Hello welcome to the Design portion of my blogging adventure! I want to use this blog to get my projects and ideas out there. I am not trying to be a web designer or full stack developer, so spending a lot of time getting this perfect wasnâ€™t a priority. Yet, I still found the default Minima theme to beâ€¦ not my style. I initially was over ambitious with my design, too many ideas. I had a eureka moment working on the design. I thought, â€˜Keep It Simple Stupidâ€™. I needed to just stick to the basics and work my way up.</p>
