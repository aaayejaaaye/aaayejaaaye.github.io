<p><strong>This week I am sitting down with my friend and fellow NASA SUITS teammate Chris Hill.</strong> He is a senior in computer science here at CU Boulder.  He is also a McNair Scholar and a Google CS Research Mentorship recipient whose research interests lie in human augmentation, sensory extension, Transhumanism, biohacking, emergent technology, and educational technology. These interests culminate in the development of sensory extensions and augmentation devices that encourage shared innovation and scientific discovery, with the intent that these open source projects have the potential to lead to a stronger augmentation community and the dispersion of more novel ideas.</p>
