<p>Ah yes, Unity, Throughout the years of being an aspiring game developer/CS graduate/billionaire/philanthropist(ehehe) I have followed hundreds of Unity tutorials. I would consider myself an intermediate beginner as a Unity user however, I find that I can still find some real quality intro Unity tutorials that I can benefit from(usually not free). If you look up Unity 3D/Game Development or any other popular keywords for aspiring game makers in an analytics tool you will see that the results are both highly sought after and alsoâ€¦ highly saturated (Iâ€™m a small fish in a big pond).<!--more--> So mulling through these results and finding the right tutorial that wont waste your time is essential in the beginning stages of you game making journey. Having said that, I have learned a few things about the DOâ€™s and DONTâ€™S of trying to follow along.
