<p>So I am not trying to be a web designer or full stack anything. I want to use this blog to get my projects and ideas out there. I am not setting gout to get the next design award. Yet, I found that I still found the default Minima theme to beâ€¦ not my style. I initially was over ambitious with my design, too many ideas. I had a eureka moment working on the design. I thought, â€˜Keep it simple stupidâ€™. I am not trying to be a web designer or anything. I needed to just stick to the basics and work my way up.</p>
