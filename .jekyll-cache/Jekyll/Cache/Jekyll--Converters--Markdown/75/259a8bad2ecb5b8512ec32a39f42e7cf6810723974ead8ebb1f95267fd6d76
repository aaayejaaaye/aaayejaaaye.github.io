I have been on a two week hiatus, I finished finals WOOHOO and have been enjoying Christmas holiday! But now It is time to utilize the rest of my winter break and really focus in on this blogging venture for a bit. I have joined Instagram and a lot of advice out there is to have an accompanying YouTube videos with your blog post. Editing takes a lot of time but I have managed to make one so far. I will save my future plans for another post. This post is going to be about reflections on 2019. I took a poll on Instagram (links below) about what my next post should be and not many people over there want to hear about Game Dev, but a few wanted to hear about my NASA SUITS experience and majority polled otherâ€¦ but no suggestions soâ€¦ here we go my NASA SUITS experience.</p>
