<p><strong>This week I am sitting down with my friend and fellow NASA SUITS teammate Chris Hill.</strong> He is a senior in computer science here at CU Boulder.  He is also a McNair Scholar and a Google CS Research Mentorship recipient whose research interests lie in human augmentation, sensory extension, Transhumanism, biohacking, emergent technology, and educational technology. These interests culminate in the development of sensory extensions and augmentation devices that encourage shared innovation and scientific discovery, with the intent that these open source projects have the potential to lead to a stronger augmentation community and the dispersion of more novel ideas.<!--more--></p>

<p>Very exciting Stuff!</p>

<p>Let me set the scene. We have just taken advantage of a promotional offer from a local facial studio. are skin is glowing and very moisturized. We decide to get lunch, tacos. We are sitting in the main room of a trendy hipster style taco joint drinking margaritas at a bar height table and its super crowded Saturday. We both have on fun printed knit cardigans, cool sneakers, and glowing skin.</p>

<p><strong>AJ:</strong> Hello Chris! Are you ready to talk about how awesome you are?</p>

<p><strong>Chris:</strong> <em>laughs</em> HI!</p>

<p><strong>AJ:</strong> So tell us about yourself?</p>

<p><strong>Chris:</strong> Alright, I am  computer science student at CU Boulder. For the past two years I’ve been doing research in human augmentation and children’s education. To give a very broad overview. I develop computationally enriched sensory extensions that help people interact and explore the world in new and novel ways.</p>

<p><strong>Definition of human augmentation:</strong> Described as the natural, artificial, or technological alteration of the human body in order to enhance physical or mental capabilities.</p>

<p><strong>AJ:</strong> Awesome, great description! How did you get interested in human augmentation?</p>

<p><strong>Chris:</strong> Yeah so about three years ago I was taking a discrete math class with the late Mike Eisenberg and I thought he was an interesting guy in class. He said he was teaching a first year seminar. I had just transferred So I was technically considered a first year student, although it was mostly freshmen in the class. I  took it and was enthralled in the idea of people in there basements or by themselves, injecting things into themselves, changing their own physiology to adapt new senses to embed technology.</p>

<p><strong>AJ:</strong> I actually say a YouTube video of people implanting microchips into their body, It was wild.</p>

<p><strong>Chris:</strong> Yeah! actually at the end of that class I injected an RFID chip into my hand.</p>

<p><strong>AJ:</strong> Oh my gosh! Is it still there then?</p>

<p><strong>Chris:</strong> No, it been cut out but you can see the scare from it.</p>

<p><strong>AJ:</strong> <em>laughs</em> their is indeed a scar their. <em>between his thumb and pointer finger there is the scare</em></p>

<p><strong>Definition of RFID:</strong> Radio Frequency Identification. It is a passive technology, that means that it remains off until it makes contact with a magnetic field. Once it gets into contact with a magnetic field or RFID reader it exchanges some kind of information. So with mine, my chip was from around 2016 so had a password and an identification key.</p>

<p><strong>AJ:</strong> Can you explain what Transhumanism and Human Augmentation mean to you?</p>

<p><strong>Chris:</strong> Transhumanism is the ideology that the next step in human evolution is going to be man made, and hardware made. I personally am not a part carrying member of the movement but I think that technology embedded into humans can provide a new opportunity for us to create art, to make new things and experience the world in new ways. It beneficial in the idea that it’ll help us adapt to new environments, possibly.
 Humans Augmentation is the idea that we can augment, or enhance, which is use that term loosely I rather say, add to humans these new experiences, new ideas. I see it as a way for humans to express themselves as a form of social expression but also as a way to mitigate interaction between humans.</p>

<p><strong>AJ:</strong> I totally agree. I definitely have thought about evolution and where technology plays a role in that. I have thought that maybe many years from now that completely artificial or, maybe by then it wont be considered artificial, but completely mechanical beings will replace organic humans, in the future… LONG! DISTANT! FUTURE!</p>

<p><strong>Chris:</strong> Yeah, I mean, one of the future implications I see of my work is, Imagine your sending and astronaut to a far distant planet and there is intelligent life on that planet. There is no guarantee that that intelligent life is able to see the same spectrum we see, have the same vocal chords or speak in the same way we do. So you’ve gone to a planet full of dogs! Dogs are going to develop technologies completely different from humans. So they’re not gonna have vacuums anywhere! Cause that will hurt their hearing.</p>

<center>A prototype from [...] project</center>

<p><strong>AJ:</strong> Aww It’s gonna be a really quiet planet!</p>

<p><strong>Chris:</strong> Exactly! Very quiet, lots of blue objects. So that’s one of the applications I see.</p>

<p><strong>AJ:</strong> We kind of talked about this off record but I’m interested to learn more about your McNair scholarship and your google CS Mentorship recipient Scholarship. How did you hear about that, get into that, and what are you doing with it?</p>

<p><strong>Chris:</strong> Yeah, so I am very bad at finding opportunities to improve me career wise. I was taking a class with my mentor at the time and he said, “Are you low income?”” I said “yes”.</p>

<p>“Are you a minority?” “Yes.”</p>

<p>“Are you interested in Grad school?”</p>

<p>And I had to think about it.
“Maybe???” I was like 20%.</p>

<p>He was like either way I’m going to nominate you.</p>
