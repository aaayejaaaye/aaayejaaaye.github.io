<p><img src="\pictures\how I Created My Blog\How I Easily Edited My Jekyll Minima Theme.png" style="margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto; display:block;" /></p>

<p>Hi Techies, So Iâ€™ve been playing around with Jekyll for about a month getting this blog running. I spent two weeks of that trying to format and edit a Jekyll them that was way past my level of understanding when I had a eureka moment of the design saying, â€˜Keep it simple stupidâ€™. I am not trying to be a web designer or anything. I needed to just stick to the basics and work my way up.<!--more--></p>

<p><img src="\pictures\how I Created My Blog\tenor.gif" style="margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto; display:block;" /></p>

<p>This tutorial is for those with Basic understanding of HTML, CSS, CMD, IDEâ€™s, etc. Of course I will not discourage someone with out any experience to not try this, Iâ€™m just gonna say, If you want this to be easy and seamless then head over to WordPress, Wix, or whatever and give them your money. No shade, seriously. If you have the basic skills, and time, you can create a blog on the cheap!</p>

<p>If you are here for the first time, Hi, Iâ€™m AJ. I am a CS Major at CU Boulder and I have interest in AR/VR/Game Dev subjects. This Blog is dedicated to highlighting thing Iâ€™ve Learned, tutorials and other cool stuff I like. Iâ€™m not big into web design or development, but that just kind of is the way things are going and being able to create a website is a useful skill set for anybody trying to put themselves out there.</p>

<p>What are We going to Learn Today!
We are going to Use <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>, a Static Site creator, and <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a>, a software hosting platform.
I am also using a Jekyll Theme: <a href="https://github.com/jekyll/minima">Minima</a>, which is the default theme, but I have altered it to make it my own.
I am doing this with Windows so if you are on Mac/Linux the Installation of Jekyll will differ.</p>

<p><strong>What will you Need:</strong></p>

<p>GitHub Account</p>

<p>Command Line Prompt</p>

<p>Domain Name(Optional)</p>

<p>W3 schools</p>

<p>JEKYLL documentation</p>

<p>Atom (or any text editor/IDE of your choice)</p>

<p>Canva (Optional)</p>

<p><strong>Installation of Jekyll:</strong></p>

<p>There is a lot of great Documentation on how to install Jekyll on you device. Head on over to the <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/">Jekyll Docs</a> and that should get you squared away. Since I am on Windows I followed the instructions <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/windows/">here</a>.</p>

<p>Now that I have Jekyll and friends installed I am going to open my command prompted. First Iâ€™ve checked my ruby and gem versions. then I switched to my Documents directory where I will host my site, then I created a new folder for my site name <strong><em>testsite</em></strong> I then ran the cmd Jekyll new testblog.
<img src="\pictures\how I Created My Blog\installjekyll1.png" /></p>

<p>now open testblog</p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>cd testblog
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Next we are going to head over to GitHub Page for the <a href="https://github.com/jekyll/minima">Minima Theme</a>
Make sure you are logged in and click the Fork button on the top right of the page.
<img src="\pictures\how I Created My Blog\installjekyll2.png" /></p>

<p>This will create this repo under your name. Go to you profile and click on this repo.
There are several ways to go about this but rename your repository to username.github.io in order for git to recognize this repository as you hosted website. for instance mine is <a href="https://aaayejaaaye.github.io/">aaayejaaaye.github.io</a> @https://aaayejaaaye.github.io/.
I recommend going to the documentation for <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a> and checking that out to see more on how this works, including documentation on Jekyll implementation.
Now we are going to open this new repo folder in Atom.
Go to file&gt;open Folder and select the â€˜minimaâ€™ folder.
make note of the file structure:</p>

<p><img src="\pictures\how I Created My Blog\installjekyll3.png" /></p>

<p>save the project and go to you cmd prompt and navigate to the minima folder. See how atom and cmd match</p>

<p><img src="\pictures\how I Created My Blog\installjekyll4.png" /></p>

<p><strong>Design Stuff:</strong></p>

<p>On The <a href="https://github.com/jekyll/minima">Minima Theme Page</a> and the <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/step-by-step/01-setup/">Jekyll Site</a> they explain really well just what all you are looking at. There are also some great <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWowJBRMtpc&amp;t=442s">YouTube Tutorials</a>. Iâ€™m going to focus more on the extras like MD formatting CSS, HTML and creating custom files.
First thing Edit your _config.yml file.
 You will se alot of presets go ahead and fill those in. Here are my relevant Presets:</p>

<p><img src="\pictures\how I Created My Blog\installjekyll7.png" /></p>

<p>save the changes and go back to your cmd prompt:</p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>jekyll serve
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>go to local host you should see that the changes to the title of the page have been made! FUN!</p>

<p>Next we are Going to Edit the About Me Page</p>

<p>In the root of your directory you should see a about.html. this is what we are going to edit. By default it includes a lot of helpful links, so I recommend checking them out before deleting them. You will see some elements in between -â€“ lines. This is called <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/front-matter/">front matter</a> which we will get into later. Iâ€™ve updated and saved and gone to localhost:4000/about/</p>

<p><img src="\pictures\how I Created My Blog\installjekyll8.png" /></p>

<p>If you want to add a picture you can use the HTML &lt;img&gt; tag.</p>

<p>I first in root created a directory named _pictures and the _ lets Jekyll know that this folder is included in the _site</p>

<p>Now I am going to show you the about.html page for this blog.</p>

<p><img src="\pictures\how I Created My Blog\installjekyll9.png" /></p>

<p>Iâ€™m feeling so exposed now!
Basically this is my current file structure and if you navigate to my About page this is what the md file for the page looks like. Iâ€™ve inserted my image using an HTML tag and the rest is writing in pretty plane English.</p>

<p><strong><em>Front matter</em></strong></p>

<p>Front matter in my FM you can see I have a Layout option. if you go to the _layouts folder you will see post.html. I like to think of the layout variable as a wrapper for how  everything inside of my _post folder.
Next you see the title variable. I feel like this is pretty self explanatory.
and then you have the permalink variable, this lets Jekyll know what page to navigate to inside the directory.</p>

<p><strong><em>CSS</em></strong></p>

<p>ok so now we wanna edit some style of the blog this first thing I di was change colors around. I navigated to the localhost:4000 and once there I right clicked and clicked inspect.
This will help guide you too the css elements you want to change.
<img src="\pictures\how I Created My Blog\installjekyll010.png" />
As you scroll over the element it will highlight which section is covers, Im going to get specific enough so that I  only have the site tile highlighted. This is what I see:</p>

<p><img src="\pictures\how I Created My Blog\installjekyll011.png" /></p>

<p>under the styles tab to the right in the .site-title, .site-vistied box we see the file and the line we need to go to to change that element. In this case layout.css:26. so back in Atom i will go to \sass &gt; minima &gt; _layout.css &gt; line 26 aka .site-title{} and insert color: #99ff33;</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>  .site-title {
    @include relative-font-size(1.625);
    font-weight: 300;
    letter-spacing: -1px;
    margin-bottom: 0;
    float: left;
    color: #99ff33;
    @include media-query($on-palm) {
      padding-right: 45px;
    }

  &amp;,
  &amp;:visited {
    color: #99ff33;
  }
}
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>now itâ€™s Lime Green.
I Continued to do this for my site-nav, post-headings, and post-links.</p>

<p><strong>DISCLAIMER:</strong>
While I love to share what Iâ€™ve learned I am definitely not saying this is the best way to go about doing this. Iâ€™m still figuring it out and while I am still trying to understand Jekyll, liquid and all the formatting involved these are the easy dirty simple solutions that seem to work. I do plan and making these more seamless with the Jekyll formatting and will be creating updated post in the future. Proceed with cautionâ€¦</p>

<p><strong><em>Creating a Banner</em></strong></p>

<p>You also may have seen the _includes folder read up on it <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/includes/">here</a>. This was the second hardest for me to grasps initially but once I understood it wasnâ€™t so bad. still a beginner tho. I wanted to have my own logo up instead of just my default name. So I am going to head to our  header.html file and using simple link and image tag I included my banner which I saved to my _picture folder.</p>

<p><img src="\pictures\how I Created My Blog\installjekyll012.png" /></p>

<p>My custom code is the &lt;a&gt; tag to create the link and in between that I have the &lt;img&gt; that is the link to my LOGO. I also did I similar thing to footer.html to include and image in there.
BTW, I created all my Logos with <a href="https://www.canva.com/">Canva</a>, I love it!</p>

<p><strong><em>Preivew Blog on Main Page</em></strong></p>

<p>You may have noticed that I have a little exceprt on the main page for each blog post, this is by design. I use a excerpt_separator variable and the  &lt;!â€“moreâ€“&gt;
 lets it no where the excerpt ends, observe:
 <img src="\pictures\how I Created My Blog\installjekyll013.png" /></p>

<p><strong><em>Push to GitHub</em></strong></p>

<p>Again, this took me a month. Dont feel like you have to do this all at once, in fact DONâ€™T! Follow these simple tricks learn, some more through hours of tutorials and google searches. in the mean time save your work and dont forget to push to git GitHub. here are the basic git commands to update your site:</p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>git add .
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>adds all your changes in all your files</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>git commit -m "Some message about the changes you made"
</code></pre></div></div>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>git push
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>or</p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>git push origin master
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Save often, google often. Thanks for hanging out with me!</p>
